# Security Fix 1: File Permissions Vulnerability

## Summary
Fixed critical security vulnerability where the AOG system was setting world-writable (777) permissions on all files, allowing any user to modify critical system files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Permission Settings (`src/src-v2-rust-alpha/src/aog/tools.rs`)
- **Removed**: Dangerous `chmod 777` that made all files world-writable
- **Added**: Secure permission settings:
  - Directories: `755` (owner: rwx, group: r-x, others: r-x)
  - Config files: `644` (owner: rw-, group: r--, others: r--)
  - Log files: `664` (owner: rw-, group: rw-, others: r--)
  - Executables: `755` (owner: rwx, group: r-x, others: r-x)

### 2. New Security Functions (`src/src-v2-rust-alpha/src/aog/tools.rs`)
- `set_ownership()`: Sets proper user/group ownership on files
- `validate_permissions()`: Validates that files are not world-writable
- Enhanced `fix_permissions()`: Intelligently sets permissions based on file type

### 3. User/Group Creation (`src/src-v2-rust-alpha/src/setup.rs`)
- `create_aog_user_and_group()`: Creates dedicated `aog` user and group
  - System user with no shell access (`/usr/sbin/nologin`)
  - Home directory set to `/opt/aog`
  - Adds sudo user to `aog` group for management

### 4. Startup Security Validation (`src/src-v2-rust-alpha/src/main.rs`)
- `validate_startup_permissions()`: Checks all critical files on startup
- `security_audit_log()`: Logs security events to `/opt/aog/security_audit.log`
- Automatically fixes insecure permissions when detected

### 5. Systemd Service Hardening (`src/src-v2-rust-alpha/src/setup.rs`)
- Service runs as dedicated `aog` user (not root)
- Added security hardening options:
  - `PrivateTmp=true`: Isolated temp directory
  - `NoNewPrivileges=true`: Prevents privilege escalation
  - `ProtectSystem=strict`: Read-only system directories
  - `ProtectHome=true`: No access to user home directories
  - `ReadWritePaths=/opt/aog`: Only AOG directory is writable

## Security Improvements

### Before
- All files had `777` permissions (world-writable)
- Service ran as root
- No permission validation
- No security audit logging
- Any user could modify critical files

### After
- Secure permissions based on file type
- Dedicated service user with minimal privileges
- Automatic permission validation on startup
- Security audit logging for all permission events
- Only authorized users can modify files

# Security Fix 2: Hardcoded Password Vulnerability

## Summary
Successfully resolved critical security vulnerability where the admin password was hardcoded as "aog" in the system.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Secure Password Storage**
- Replaced plaintext password storage with Argon2 hashing algorithm
- Passwords are now stored as secure hashes that cannot be reversed
- Each password hash includes a unique salt for additional security

### 2. **Password Generation**
- System generates cryptographically secure random passwords (16-24 characters)
- Generated passwords include:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Passwords meet strict complexity requirements

### 3. **Authentication Module** (`src/aog/auth.rs`)
- Created dedicated authentication module with:
  - `hash_password()`: Securely hashes passwords using Argon2
  - `verify_password()`: Safely verifies passwords against stored hashes
  - `validate_password_strength()`: Enforces password complexity requirements
  - `generate_secure_password()`: Creates cryptographically secure passwords
  - `change_password()`: Allows secure password changes
  - `reset_password()`: Provides password reset functionality

### 4. **Setup Process Updates**
- Initial setup now generates a secure random password
- Password is displayed ONCE during installation for the administrator to save
- Option to set initial password via `AOG_INITIAL_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Password must meet strength requirements even when set via environment

### 5. **HTTP Authentication Updates**
- Updated authentication to use secure password verification
- Removed direct password comparison
- Added proper error handling for authentication failures

### 6. **Password Requirements**
- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Maximum length: 128 characters
- Must contain at least one:
  - Uppercase letter
  - Lowercase letter
  - Number
  - Special character

## Files Modified
- `Cargo.toml` - Added argon2 dependency
- `src/lib.rs` - Updated Config initialization to use secure passwords
- `src/aog.rs` - Added auth module export
- `src/aog/auth.rs` - New authentication module (created)
- `src/aog/http.rs` - Updated to use secure password verification
- `src/setup.rs` - Added secure password generation during setup
- `tests/auth_integration_tests.rs` - Added comprehensive auth tests

## Testing
All authentication tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Password hashing and verification
- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Secure password generation
- ✅ Unique password generation
- ✅ Hash format validation
- ✅ Environment variable password support
- ✅ No hardcoded passwords in codebase

## Security Improvements
1. **No plaintext passwords** - All passwords are hashed before storage
2. **Timing attack resistant** - Argon2 provides constant-time comparison
3. **Rainbow table resistant** - Each password has a unique salt
4. **Brute force resistant** - Argon2 is computationally expensive
5. **Configurable** - Admins can set initial password via environment variable

## Overall Deployment Notes

1. **User Creation**: The system will automatically create the `aog` user and group on first run
2. **Permission Migration**: Existing installations will have permissions automatically fixed on startup
3. **Password Setup**: On first installation, the system will generate and display a secure password
4. **Service Restart**: After update, restart the service: `sudo systemctl restart aog.service`
5. **Audit Log**: Monitor `/opt/aog/security_audit.log` for security events
6. **Password Management**: Administrators MUST save the initial password as it won't be shown again

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Service runs with minimal required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (permissions, ownership, systemd hardening, password hashing)
3. **Audit Trail**: All security events are logged
4. **Automatic Remediation**: Insecure permissions are automatically fixed
5. **Separation of Duties**: Dedicated service user separate from system users
6. **Cryptographic Security**: Industry-standard password hashing with Argon2

## Compliance
These changes align with common security standards:
- CIS Benchmarks for Linux
- NIST security guidelines
- OWASP best practices for file permissions and authentication

## Impact
- **Security**: Significantly reduced attack surface
- **Stability**: No impact on functionality
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead from permission checks and password hashing
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatible with existing installations

## Recommendations
1. Change the default password immediately after installation
2. Use a password manager to store the admin password
3. Regularly update passwords according to security policy
4. Monitor security audit logs regularly
5. Consider implementing additional security measures:
   - Password expiration policies
   - Failed login attempt limits
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Enhanced audit logging for all authentication events
