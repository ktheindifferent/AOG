# Security Fix: Hardcoded Password Vulnerability

## Summary
Successfully resolved critical security vulnerability where the admin password was hardcoded as "aog" in the system.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Secure Password Storage**
- Replaced plaintext password storage with Argon2 hashing algorithm
- Passwords are now stored as secure hashes that cannot be reversed
- Each password hash includes a unique salt for additional security

### 2. **Password Generation**
- System generates cryptographically secure random passwords (16-24 characters)
- Generated passwords include:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Passwords meet strict complexity requirements

### 3. **Authentication Module** (`src/aog/auth.rs`)
- Created dedicated authentication module with:
  - `hash_password()`: Securely hashes passwords using Argon2
  - `verify_password()`: Safely verifies passwords against stored hashes
  - `validate_password_strength()`: Enforces password complexity requirements
  - `generate_secure_password()`: Creates cryptographically secure passwords
  - `change_password()`: Allows secure password changes
  - `reset_password()`: Provides password reset functionality

### 4. **Setup Process Updates**
- Initial setup now generates a secure random password
- Password is displayed ONCE during installation for the administrator to save
- Option to set initial password via `AOG_INITIAL_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Password must meet strength requirements even when set via environment

### 5. **HTTP Authentication Updates**
- Updated authentication to use secure password verification
- Removed direct password comparison
- Added proper error handling for authentication failures

### 6. **Password Requirements**
- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Maximum length: 128 characters
- Must contain at least one:
  - Uppercase letter
  - Lowercase letter
  - Number
  - Special character

## Files Modified
- `Cargo.toml` - Added argon2 dependency
- `src/lib.rs` - Updated Config initialization to use secure passwords
- `src/aog.rs` - Added auth module export
- `src/aog/auth.rs` - New authentication module (created)
- `src/aog/http.rs` - Updated to use secure password verification
- `src/setup.rs` - Added secure password generation during setup
- `tests/auth_integration_tests.rs` - Added comprehensive auth tests

## Testing
All authentication tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Password hashing and verification
- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Secure password generation
- ✅ Unique password generation
- ✅ Hash format validation
- ✅ Environment variable password support
- ✅ No hardcoded passwords in codebase

## Security Improvements
1. **No plaintext passwords** - All passwords are hashed before storage
2. **Timing attack resistant** - Argon2 provides constant-time comparison
3. **Rainbow table resistant** - Each password has a unique salt
4. **Brute force resistant** - Argon2 is computationally expensive
5. **Configurable** - Admins can set initial password via environment variable

## Deployment Notes
1. On first installation, the system will generate and display a secure password
2. Administrators MUST save this password as it won't be shown again
3. Existing installations should reset their password after update
4. The password can be changed through the web interface after login

## Recommendations
1. Change the default password immediately after installation
2. Use a password manager to store the admin password
3. Regularly update passwords according to security policy
4. Consider implementing:
   - Password expiration policies
   - Failed login attempt limits
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Audit logging for authentication events
