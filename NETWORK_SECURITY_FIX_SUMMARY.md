# Network Security Fix Summary

## Critical Security Issue Fixed
The HTTP/HTTPS servers were binding to `0.0.0.0` (all network interfaces), exposing the admin interface to potential network attacks. This has been fixed to bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only) by default.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Structure Updates (`src/src-v2-rust-alpha/src/lib.rs`)
- Added new configuration fields to the `Config` struct:
  - `https_bind_address`: HTTPS server bind address (default: "127.0.0.1")
  - `https_bind_port`: HTTPS server port (default: 8443)
  - `command_api_bind_address`: Command API bind address (default: "127.0.0.1")
  - `command_api_bind_port`: Command API port (default: 9443)

### 2. Server Binding Updates (`src/src-v2-rust-alpha/src/aog/http.rs`)
- **HTTPS Server (line 81-90)**: Changed from hardcoded `"0.0.0.0:8443"` to use configuration with default `"127.0.0.1:8443"`
- **Command API (line 303-311)**: Changed from hardcoded `"0.0.0.0:9443"` to use configuration with default `"127.0.0.1:9443"`
- Added logging to show which address/port the servers are binding to

### 3. Documentation Added
- **SECURITY.md**: Comprehensive security guide including:
  - Default secure configuration details
  - Instructions for secure remote access (SSH tunneling, reverse proxy, VPN)
  - Firewall configuration examples
  - Security best practices
  - Incident response procedures

### 4. Testing Script
- **test_network_security.sh**: Script to verify that servers are only accessible from localhost

## Security Benefits
1. **Default Secure**: Servers now only listen on localhost by default
2. **Configurable**: Can be changed if needed, but requires explicit configuration
3. **No Remote Access**: External networks cannot connect directly to the admin interface
4. **Documented**: Clear guidance on how to set up secure remote access when needed

## Configuration Example
To modify binding addresses (not recommended unless you understand the security implications):

```json
{
  "https_bind_address": "127.0.0.1",
  "https_bind_port": 8443,
  "command_api_bind_address": "127.0.0.1",
  "command_api_bind_port": 9443
}
```

## Testing
Run the test script to verify security:
```bash
./test_network_security.sh
```

## Recommendation
Keep the default localhost binding and use SSH tunneling for remote access:
```bash
ssh -L 8443:localhost:8443 -L 9443:localhost:9443 user@raspberry-pi
```
